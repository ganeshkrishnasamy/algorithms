# Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
# Runs O(n^2) time even if the array is sorted. It can be optimized by stopping the algorithm if inner loop didnâ€™t cause any swap

#Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.

#Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.

#Auxiliary Space: O(1)

#Boundary Cases: Bubble sort takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.

#Sorting In Place: Yes

#Stable: Yes
